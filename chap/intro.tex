\section[Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles]{Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles}

Since the industrial revolution, autonomous machines have become a big contributor to increased human productivity.
From the steam engine and assembly line conveyor belt, autonomous machines take over repetitive, labor intensive tasks and leave human with tasks requiring more attention to details but less labor.
Every year, the list of tasks automated by machines grow bigger.
Vehicles were one of the first few machines predicted to be automated, yet Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (AUV) just recently became commercially available, although in smaller scales.

With the advent of commercially available small AUV, we can automate tasks such as surveying, sensor network distribution and inspection, which previously require intensive human labor.
Simple survying with visual, sonar and laser sensor with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become commercially available.
UAV photography is becoming a booming business, with turn key solution packages.
Enabling photo and movie studios to get aerial footage and pictures without the need for expensive helicopter rentals.
UAV surveying with traditional or modified surveying equipment reduce the cost of surveying sites for constructions or archeological digs.
