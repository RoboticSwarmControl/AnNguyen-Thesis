%This paper introduces techniques for mosquito population surveys in the field using electrified screens (bug zappers) mounted to a UAV. Instrumentation on the UAV logs the UAV path and the GPS location, altitude, and time of each mosquito elimination. 
%Hardware experiments with a UAV equipped with an electrified screen provide real-time measurements of (former) mosquito locations and mosquito-free volumes.
%Planning a trajectory for the UAV that maximizes the number of mosquito kills is related to the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Lawn Mower Problem and, most closely, Milling with Turn Cost. 
%We reduce this problem to considering variants of covering a grid graph with minimum turn cost, corresponding
%to optimized energy consumption. 
%We describe an exact method based on Integer Programming that is able to compute provably optimal instances with over 1,500 pixels. 
%These solutions are then implemented on the UAV.

%\section{Introduction}
%
%Mosquito-borne diseases kill millions of humans each year~\cite{murray2012global}. 
% Because of this threat, governments worldwide track mosquito populations.
% Tracking individual mosquitoes is difficult because of their small size, wide-ranging flight, and preference for low-light.
% Tracking studies of individual mosquitos have chosen to use small ($\SI{1.2}{\metre} \times \SI{2.4}{\metre}$) indoor regions~\cite{parker2015infrared}, or mating swarms backlit against a solid background~\cite{butail20113d}.
%
%The dominant tools for tracking mosquito populations are stationary traps that are checked at weekly intervals (\textit{e.g.} Encephalitis Vector Surveillance traps and/or gravid traps~\cite{williams2007comparison}). 
%Recent research has focused on making these traps smaller, cheaper, and capable of providing real-time data~\cite{chen2014flying,linn2016building}; however, they still rely on attracting mosquitoes to the trap. 
% This paper presents an alternate solution using an electrified bug-zapping screen mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DroneAndNet} to seek out the mosquitoes in their habitat.  As the UAV follows a path, it sweeps out a volume of air, temporarily removing all the mosquitoes in this volume.  By monitoring the voltage across this screen, we can track individual mosquito contacts.
%     UAVs have strict energy budgets, so optimized flight patterns are of crucial importance. As a consequence, putting
%the UAV to good use requires
%methods for computing trajectories that minimize energy consumption along the way, but maximize the total volume of mosquitoes 
%at visited locations.
%
%%the available flight time depends on the flight pattern, as making it crucial to optimize the used trajectories. As it turns out, threquires the utility of a which makes it necessary to  which limit the flight time to a maximum denoted by $T$.
%    %The goal is to design a trajectory for the mosquito screen with duration less than $T$ that maximizes the number of mosquito eliminations.

%   % This process can be modeled as sampling without replacement from a point cloud of mobile particles using a mobile agent.  The point cloud particles are generated from a known or unknown distribution, and the mobile agent clears all particles in a swept-out region each time step. 
%%    UAVs have strict energy budgets, which limit the flight time to a maximum denoted by $T$.
%%    The goal is to design a trajectory for the mosquito screen with duration less than $T$ that maximizes the number of mosquito eliminations.%, in probability, samples the most particles.  
%%   We assume the agent can detect each particle collision and can use these detections to modify a planned trajectory.
%%    This paper presents both open-loop trajectories and policies with feedback.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
%  \noindent \emph{Robotic Coverage}: 
%    Robotic coverage has a long history. The basic problem is one of designing a path for a robot that ensures the robot visits within $r$ distance of every point on the workspace.  For an overview see~\cite{Choset2001}.  This work has been extended to use multiple coverage robots in a variety of ways, including using simple behaviors for the robots~\cite{spears2006physics,Koenig2001}.
%%This is closely related to the art gallery problem~\cite{lee1986computational} but with limited range of visibility.
% %   The key difference in the mosquito coverage problem is that the mosquitoes can move, recontaminating an area previously cleared. We instead have a probability of coverage, as in~\cite{Das2011}.  
%    
%\noindent  \emph{Mosquito Control Solutions}:
%	Mosquito control also has a long history of efforts associated both with monitoring mosquito populations~\cite{dennett2007associations} and with eliminating mosquitoes.  The work involves both draining potential breeding grounds and destroying living mosquitoes~\cite{peter2005tick}.  An array of insecticidal compounds has been used with different application methods, concentrations, and quantities, including both larvicides and compounds directed at adult mosquitoes~\cite{larvicides2005guidelines}.
%	
%	Various traps have been designed to capture and/or kill mosquitoes with increasing sophistication in imitating human bait, as designers strive to achieve a trap that can rival the attraction of a live human~\cite{maliti2015development}.  In recent history, methods have also included genetically modifying mosquitoes so that they either cannot reproduce effectively or cannot transmit diseases successfully~\cite{marshall2009malaria}, and with the recent genomic mapping of mosquito species, new ideas for more targeted work have been formulated~\cite{hill2005arthropod}.
%	
%	Popular methods to control mosquitoes such as insecticides are effective, but they have the potential to introduce long-term environmental damage and mosquitoes have demonstrated the ability to become resistant to pesticides~\cite{ndiath2012resistance}. Traditional electrified screens (bug zappers) use UV light to attract pests but have a large bycatch of non-pest insects~\cite{University-Of-Florida1997}. 
%%	This paper introduces techniques using bug zappers mounted on unmanned vehicles to autonomously seek %out and eliminate mosquitoes in their breeding grounds and swarms. Instrumentation on the bug zappers %logs the GPS location, altitude, weather details, and time of each mosquito hit.  Mosquito control %offices can use this information to analyze the insects' activities. The device can be mounted on a %remote-controlled or autonomous unmanned vehicle. If autonomous, the vehicle can use the data collected %from the electrified screen as feedback to improve the effectiveness of the motion plan. 
%	
%  \noindent  \emph{Robotic Pest Management}:
%As GPS technology has flourished and data processing has become cheaper and more readily available, researchers have explored options for implementing the new technologies in breeding ground removal~\cite{anupa2014identification} and more effective insecticide dispersion~\cite{hur2015low}.  Low-cost UAVs for residential spraying are under development~\cite{amenyo2014medizdroids}.  Even optical solutions have been considered, including laser containment~\cite{boonsri2012laser} or, by extension, exclusion and laser tracking and extermination~\cite{kare2010build}.

%  \section{Hardware Design}\label{Sec:HardwareDesign}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  This section examines the components of the mosquito UAV system, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DroneAndNet}. This includes the UAV, electrified screen, surveying electronics, and a discussion of the energy budget. 
% % The design for the mosquito UAV system been assigned a U.S.\ Provisional Patent Application~\cite{Becker2016patentapp}.
%  
%  \subsection{UAV}
%  
%The UAV is a custom-built, $\SI{177}{\centi\metre}$ wingspan hexacopter, controlled by a Pixhawk flight controller running ArduPilot Mega flight software. The UAV has a 3DR GPS module using the UBlox NEO-7 chipset.
%
%  \subsection{Screen Design}
%     The mosquito screen is designed to eliminate high density mosquito populations. 
%  This screen was constructed from two expanded aluminum mesh panels, spaced apart by \SI{3}{\milli\metre} thick ABS grid. 
%   These mesh panels have \SI{12}{\milli\metre} diamond-shaped  openings, and is held taught by nylon bolts around the perimeter.  
%   The bottom mesh panel is offset by half a diamond (6 mm) to the right to ensure all insects greater than 6 mm cannot pass through the net.
%     The top mesh is held at the reference voltage and the bottom mesh is energized to $1.8~kV$ above the reference voltage.
%     
%  The perimeter is reinforced by two sets of \SI{7}{\milli\metre} diameter fiberglass rods that are inset into 3D printed corner fixtures.
%  These rods protect the frame from getting damaged from any side, and allows the UAV to land without damaging the net.
%
%
%Once assembled, the net weighs \SI{0.948}{\kilogram} and has an overall area of \SI{0.194}{\square\metre}, with the spacer occupying \SI{0.0325}{\square\metre}. 
%This makes the effective net area \SI{0.161}{\square\metre}. %, and the total cost of building a net this size is only \$27.44 USD.
%   
%   
%
%  %Design files and build instructions are available at~\cite{Vinh2016BugNet}.
%
%
%  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  \subsection{Screen Location}
% The UAV carries the bug-zapping screen, which is suspended by paracord rope at each corner.  The location of this screen determines the efficacy of the mosquito UAV, measured in mosquitoes detected per second of flight time. The following describes a simplified analysis to optimize the screen location.
%
%For manufacturing ease, the electrified screen is a rectangle with a width of $d_s$. The screen is suspended a distance $h_s$ beneath the UAV flying at height $h_d$.  We chose to suspend the screen beneath the UAV to avoid the weight of the rigid frame that would be required if the screen were above the UAV and because most mosquito species prefer low flight~\cite{gillies1976vertical}.  This screen can be suspended at any desired angle $\theta$ in comparison to horizontal, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DroneConfigs}.
%Two key parameters are the distance $h_s$ and the optimal angle $\theta$.  The goal is to clear the greatest volume of mosquitoes per second, a volume defined by the UAV forward velocity $v_f$ and the cross-sectional area $h_m \times d_s$ cleared by the screen, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:AngleVsSpeed}.
%
% To hover, the UAV must push sufficient air down with velocity $v_d$ to apply a force that cancels the pull of gravity.  The UAV and screen combined have mass $m_{d}$ and its cross section can be approximated as a square with a side length of $d_d$.  The mass flow of air through the UAV's propellers is equal to the product of the change in velocity of the air, the density of the air $\rho_a$, and the cross sectional area.
% 
%     \begin{figure}
%\centering
%\begin{overpic}[width=\columnwidth]{DroneConfigs.pdf}\end{overpic}
%\caption{\label{fig:DroneConfigs}
%The UAV suspends a rectangular bug-zapping screen beneath it.  Propwash pushes incoming mosquitoes downwards, and the UAV clears a volume $h_m \times d_s \times v_f$ each second. Circles show two mosquitoes at equal time intervals relative to the UAV.} 
%\vspace{-1em}
%\end{figure}
%
%
%We assume that air above the UAV is quiescent, so the change in velocity of the air is $v_d~ \si{\metre\per\second}$.
% \begin{align} \label{eq:forceBalanceForDrone}
% \text{Force gravity} & = \left(\text{mass flow}\right) \cdot \text{air velocity} \nonumber \\
% m_{d} \cdot  g &= (v_d \cdot  \rho_a \cdot  d_d^2 ) \cdot  v_d 
%% \text{kg} \cdot \frac{ \text{m}}{ \text{s}^2}&= \left( \frac{ \text{m}}{\text{s}} \cdot  \frac{ \text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}  \cdot \text{m}^2 \right) \cdot  \frac{ \text{m}}{\text{s}}\nonumber
%\end{align}
%
%Then the required \emph{propwash}, the velocity of air beneath the UAV, for hovering is
% \begin{align} \label{eq:dronePropwash}
%v_d = \sqrt{ \frac{ m_d g}{\rho_a d_d^2} }
%\end{align}
%The flight testing site in Houston, Texas is \SI{15}{\metre} above sea level. At sea level the density of air $\rho_a$ is \SI{1.225}{\kilogram\per\cubic\metre}.
%The UAV and instrumentation combined weigh \SI{5.1}{\kilogram} with a width of \SI{0.75}{\metre}. The acceleration due to gravity is \SI{9.871}{\metre\per\square\second}.  Substituting these values gives $v_d = \SI{8.5}{\metre\per\second}$.
%
%Due to propwash, an initially hovering mosquito will fall when under the UAV at a rate of $v_d$.  Relative to the UAV, the mosquito moves horizontally at a rate of $-v_f$.  As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DroneConfigs}, we can extend lines with slope $-v_d/v_f$ from the screen's trailing edge to $h_{\textrm{top}}$ and from the leading edge to $h_{\textrm{bottom}}$.
% \begin{align} \label{eq:ClearedCrossSection}
%h_{\textrm{top}} &= h_d - h_s + \frac{d_s}{2} \sin(\theta) +  \frac{d_d + d_s\cos(\theta)}{2}  \frac{v_d}{v_f} \nonumber \\
%h_{\textrm{bottom}} &= h_d - h_s - \frac{d_s}{2} \sin(\theta) +  \frac{d_d - d_s\cos(\theta)}{2}  \frac{v_d}{v_f}  \nonumber \\
%h_m &= h_{\textrm{top}} - h_{\textrm{bottom}} =  d_s\left(\frac{v_d}{v_f}\cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) \right)
%\end{align}
%The optimal angle is therefore a function of forward and propwash velocity:
%\begin{align} \label{eq:OptimalScreenAngle}
%\ \theta = \mathrm{ArcTan}\left(\frac{v_f}{v_d}\right)
%\end{align}
%
%To ensure the maximum number of mosquitoes are collected, the screen must be sufficiently far below the UAV $ h_s > \frac{d_s}{2} \sin(\theta) +  \frac{d_d + d_s\cos(\theta)}{2}  \frac{v_d}{v_f}$  and the bottom of the screen must not touch the ground, $ h_d > h_s + \frac{d_s}{2} \sin(\theta) $.
%

%\caption{\label{fig:AngleVsSpeed}
%The volume cleared by a UAV is a function of screen angle $\theta$ and forward velocity $v_f$.  Dotted line shows the optimal angle given in \eqref{eq:OptimalScreenAngle}. } 
%\vspace{-1em}
%\end{figure}
% 
%There are practical limits to $h_s$ as well.  Tests with $h_s > \SI{2}{\metre}$ were abandoned because the long length caused the screen to act as a pendulum, introducing dynamics that made the system difficult to fly.
% 
%Changing the flying height $h_d$ of the UAV will target different mosquito populations because mosquitoes are not distributed uniformly vertically. 
% Gillies and Wilkes demonstrated that different species of mosquitoes prefer to fly at different heights~\cite{gillies1976vertical}. 
% 
%   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   \subsection{Wind Tunnel Verification of Net Angle}
%   
%This section describes experiments run in a wind tunnel to verify the simplified net angle analysis in the previous section. 
%Smoke streaklines were used to visualize the flow of air as it passed by the UAV.
%Due to space constraints in the wind tunnel, a free-flying phantom 4 was used instead of the hexacopter used for carrying the zapper. 
%The wind tunnel was set to a \SI{3}{\metre\per\second} flow speed, and the UAV manually flown in approximately stable hovering.
%The solo UAV is \num{0.3} $\times$ \num{0.3} $\times$ \SI{0.2}{\metre}.  The windtunnel has a \SI{1}{\metre} $\times$ \SI{1}{\metre} cross section. 
%%??? brand name of the smoking apparatus?
%As seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:WindTunnel}, the proposed screen position captures free flowing air and air entrained by the UAV propellers.
%This test encouraged us to mount the net as close to the UAV as possible, so that air, and flying mosquitos, entrained by the propellers are pushed into the net.

%   \subsection{Data Logger}
%   
%   The electrical detection and logging system is powered by a $9~V$ lithium ion battery applied directly to the controller and two AA $3~V$ lithium ion batteries applied to the power circuit for the screen.
%   The controller uses a GPS shield for monitoring the location and altitude as well as a real time clock to timestamp each data point collected from the system.
%   A Raspberry Pi 3 is used for data logging, 
%       sensors include a GPS sensor (NEO-6M Ublox), 
%      a capacitive humidity sensor, a thermistor (DHT22),
%   %ADS1115 16-bit ADC for monitoring the supply-side voltage of the net, and 
%   and an INA219 high side, 12-bit DC current sensor for monitoring the supply-side current delivered to the net.
%   The net current draw is logged at 100 Hz, while GPS and weather sensor data is logged at 1Hz.  
%   All data is stored on an onboard SD card.

%  } 
%  \vspace{-1em}
%\end{figure}
% % \todo{what is the new energy usage of the screen?}
%  
%  
%  Tests with an oscilloscope show that in the steady state, a $\SI{30.5}{\centi\metre} \times \SI{61}{\centi\metre}$ screen and electronics have a power consumption of \SI{3.6}{\watt}.  During a zap, the screen voltage monitoring circuit shorts briefly when the mosquito contacts the screen.  Figure~\ref{fig:BugZapTrace} shows the time sequences for battery and screen voltages, current, and power during five mosquito zaps.  
%% % WE COULD NOT JUSTIFY THIS EQUATION 
%%%  The initial current spike recovery can be modeled with an exponential fit.
%%%
%% \begin{align} \label{eq:BugZapFit}
%%i=69.1e^{-2.7\times10^4 t} ~A
%%\end{align}
%%%
%%The fit in \eqref{eq:BugZapFit} gives a time constant of $36~\mu s$ for the short and a recovery time of $80~\mu s$. 
% Multiplying voltage by current to find the instantaneous power ($p=iv$) and integrating the area under the power curve show a total energy consumption of \SI{4.2}{\milli\joule} for each zap.  Recharging the screen requires more power and is represented in the latter part of the curves.  The overall recovery time is about $\SI{160}{\milli\second}$.  Most of the energy is consumed charging and maintaining the charge on the screen rather than in zapping the mosquitoes.

%
%A boustrophedon (back-and-forth) path with \SI{2}{\metre} spacing was generated to cover a region $\SI{120}{\metre} \times \SI{15}{\metre}$ at height $\SI{1.5}{\metre}$.
%The path was generated using Mission Planner software from ardupilot.org~\cite{Ardupilot}.
%
%For each trial the UAV took off from a resting position on top of the screen.
%Flight began manually, with a piloted takeoff of the UAV. After establishing a stable hover at $\SI{3}{\metre}$, control was switched to the autonomous flight plan.
%The pilot monitored the flight with the ability to switch to manual operation in case of potential crashes due to GPS error or hazards in the flight plan.
%Mosquito strikes detected by the data logger were verified using a GoPro Hero 4 Silver camera attached at the top of the net, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DroneAndNet}.
%At night and twilight, the sparks could be detected both visually and audibly from the recorded video.
%During the day, the sparks were loud enough to observe over the audio channel of the videos.
%
%The UAV flew eight missions on this field, covering the same path.
%It was mainly flown in the early morning and late afternoon, when mosquito activities are more active.
%Three flights were flown at noon and early afternoon to ensure that mosquito activities during these periods were not ignored.
%However, only two mosquito strikes were observed during this period.
%The path covered is about $\SI{1}{\kilo\metre}$ long and typically takes $\SI{12}{\minute}$.
%
%Over the eight missions on this field, there were a total of 11 mosquito strikes.
%Figure \ref{fig:strikemap} shows the mission's flight path and the map of all collected strikes.
%The mosquito strikes are concentrated at the north and south ends of the field, where there are more trees.
% A density map was generated from the collected strikes' position by representing each strike by a Gaussian distribution with the norm on the strike's location and a $\sigma$ of $\SI{10}{\metre}$.
%Figure \ref{fig:densitymap} shows the density map generated by summing these Gaussian distributions.

%These results not only tell where mosquitoes were but also show where mosquitoes were not.
%This is a key difference from stationary traps such as~\cite{chen2014flying,linn2016building}.

%\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
%
%This paper presented an approach for finding optimal tours given turn costs and an energy budget, inspired by a mosquito-killing UAV with limited battery life. 
%Initial experiments with the UAV and electrified screen track the location of a mosquito-killing UAV as it patrols a field and maps mosquito kills.  
%
%%Future work
%Many refinements to the algorithm could be pursued in future work, including changes to both the mosquito-biasing algorithm and the robot flight simulation.  The model may be expanded to continuous space, three dimensions, and to arbitrary turn angles.  These and other considerations will make a more realistic model for future work.  
%
%Further testing of the multi-copter UAV is indicated and will allow more extensive testing of the robustness and accuracy of the hardware design. New sensors that can identify and detect flying insects~\cite{chen2014flying} may be added to the UAV and enable it to proactively steer toward insect swarms and identify insects in realtime.
%
%The concept may be extended to a non-destructive population survey in which the screen could be replaced with a net and, with appropriate lighting, the camera used to record capture events.  Teams of UAVs could work together to map areas more quickly and, by measuring gradients of the distribution, quickly find large mosquito populations.
