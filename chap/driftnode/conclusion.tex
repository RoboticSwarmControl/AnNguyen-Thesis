\section[Conclusion]{Conclusion and future work}

The drifting sensor node we presented can be deployed as a wireless sensor network.
The driftnodes can be deployed on coastlines to gather information before a military mission.
It can also be used to monitor national ocean borders or marine habitats.

For depth sensing, the commercially available fish finding transducer can be used with current open source software to communicate in NMEA 2000.
In environments with better water clarity, we can add a camera to the driftnode for more information.

Another researcher is also working on making the driftnode smaller and lighter.
This would allow researchers to transport more sensors, and easier for an AUV to recover the sensor at the end of the mission.
