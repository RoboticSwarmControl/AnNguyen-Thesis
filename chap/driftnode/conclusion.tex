\section[Conclusion]{Conclusion and future work}

The drifting sensor node we presented can be deployed as a wireless sensor network.
The driftnodes can be deployed on coast line to gather information before a military mission.
It can also be used to monitor national ocean borders, or marine habitats.

For depth sensing, the commercially available fish finding transducer can be used with current open source software to communicate in NMEA 2000.
A camera can also be added for environments with better water clarity, so more information can be gained from the driftnode.

Another researcher is also working on making the driftnode smaller and lighter.
This would make it easier to transport more sensors for deployment, and easier for an AUV to recover the sensor at the end of a mission.
