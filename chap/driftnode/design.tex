You can see the driftnode's shell and electronics in Fig.~\ref{fig:driftnodeoverview}.
The current driftnode shell is an improvement upon the driftnode from \cite{drifterUSC}.
It is composed of a $\SI{43}{\centi\metre}$ PVC pipe, with 3D printed male threaded bushing glued to top and bottom of the pipe.
The glue joints and exterior surfaces of the male threaded bushing are coated with a rubber silicone coating for waterproofing.
The driftnode's bottom and top caps can be threaded on to the threaded bushing on the pipe, completing the exterior of the drift node.
The bottom cap has sensors incorporated.
After the sensors are installed, the exterior surfaces of the cap are coated in the same rubber silicone coating as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensorcap}.
The sensors used are all waterproof for their sensing elements.
The threaded sensor and top caps allow easy removal of the inside electronics and sensor for charging, debugging and improvement.

The driftnode's primary electronics include a Raspberry Pi 3 embedded computer for logging sensor data and broadcasting the wireless access point.
The Raspberry Pi 3 is powered by a $\SI{10}{\amperehour}$ portable USB battery.
We used a proto-hat on the Raspberry Pi to facilitate easy connection to sensors.

The driftnode can record its position with a commercially available GPS unit, in this case, it is the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout board, connected to an extended GPS antenna.
The GPS sensor talks to the Raspberry Pi via serial communication.
We can record the orientation of the driftnode with a 9-axis inertial measurement unit sensor, in this case, a Pololu MinIMU-9 v5.
We also have an analog turbidity sensor and a pressure sensor for the driftnode, both output analog voltages, which is then converted to digital signal by the ADS1115 16-bit ADC board by Adafruit.
both the IMU and ADC board communicate to the Raspberry Pi through I$^{2}$C.

We have attempted to find a suitable underwater depth sensor.
We need a sensor that is small, preferably lightweight, and relatively easy to interface.
However, many available depth sensors do not meet these requirements.
When speaking of underwater depth sensing via distance, fish finder sensors come to mind.
These sensors also output a point cloud similar to LIDAR sensor or depth cameras.
However, we have not been able to find a resource to interface with them quickly.
All commercially available fish finder sensors are coupled with either a visualizer or communicate with proprietary visualizing software.
Another member of our lab is working on reverse engineering fish finder sensors.
Fish finders are also typically larger than the area available in our sensor cap.
We have found two sensors, with a compromise on accuracy.
One is the MB7380 by MaxBotix, which is a weatherproofed sonar sensor that could be further waterproofed then incorporated into our driftnode.
The second sensor is a JSN-SR04T based sonar sensor with a sonar probe connected by a waterproof cable.
These two sensors were designed to be used in the air, with the waterproofing feature intended to make them more reliable outdoor.
However, we retrofitted them to work underwater, taking into account that the speed of sound in water is $\SI{1498}{\metre/\second}$, four times faster than the speed of sound in air $\SI{343}{\metre/\second}$.

We left out the camera since our testing environment has very murky water.
Additionally, our turbidity, pressure, and range sensors have taken up most of the area of the sensor cap.
Which can be added back in at a later date when we have a wider area for our sensor cap, or possibly a transparent tube which allow us to mount the camera facing to the side.

\subsection[Software]{Software}

The Raspberry Pi 3 is installed with embedded Linux operating system Raspbian.
Raspbian is based on Debian, which can run a simple version of the Robotics Operating System (ROS).
ROS allows us to communicate between multiple software nodes hosted on multiple computers.
This means we can easily connect one drift node to another, or a driftnode to a data collecting embedded computer carried on an AUV.

All sensors are logged using ROS bag files.
Each sensor has its own Python script file that publishes on a topic for that sensor.
The GPS data is published with \textit{sensor\_msgs/NavSatFix} messages.
The IMU data is published with \textit{sensor\_msgs/IMU} messages.
The turbidity data is published with \textit{sensor\_msgs/Illuminance} messages.
The range data is published with \textit{sensor\_msgs/Range} messages.
The pressure data is published with \textit{sensor\_msgs/FluidPressure} messages.
Because ROS messages are recorded with publishing time and host name, sensor messages can be played back synchronously.


Fig~\ref{fig:driftvis} shows visualizations for the GPS trace and the IMU data.
The GPS trace can be graphed by an online GPS visualizer, such as \emph{http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/}.
The IMU data is visualized to show the orientation of the drift node, using Rviz, a ROS tool.
The other data streams can be overlayed on to the GPS trace.
