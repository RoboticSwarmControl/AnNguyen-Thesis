An Unmanned Vehicle, such as a flying multi-copter, an unmanned rover, an remote-controlled boat, can be used to cover large area of land, to perform repetitive, tedious yet strenuous task for human.
We can have an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) distribute a network of seismic microphone, used during seismic surveying, in treacherous terrain, free of heavy audio wiring, without risking injury to human worker.
We can have an UAV sweep a large area with a mosquito zapping net, destructively sampling mosquito population in the area, giving entomology researcher better data about their distribution and behavior through time and space.
We can have an Unmanned boat, or a UAV, distribute a drifting Wireless Sensor Network into a body of water.
The same, or several Unmanned Vehicles, can then monitor, recharge and finally recollect them.
The following thesis present hardware for all of the above applications, as well as software and algorithms for the Unmanned Vehicles, and sensor nodes.
